# Keylogger Project

This repository contains a Python-based keylogger designed to capture keystrokes on a target machine and print the log at regular intervals. The keylogger is intended for educational purposes, such as demonstrating how keyloggers work, and should only be used in a controlled, authorized environment.

## Features

- Captures keystrokes and stores them in a log.
- Prints the log to the console at specified intervals.
- Written in Python 3.

## Disclaimer

**This project is for educational purposes only. Unauthorized use of this keylogger is illegal and unethical. Use it only with explicit permission and in a controlled environment.**

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- [pynput](https://pypi.org/project/pynput/) library for capturing keystrokes

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/arifbinekram/Keylogger-Project.git
    cd Keylogger-Project
    ```

2. **Install the required library:**
    ```bash
    pip install pynput
    ```

## Usage

1. **Edit the script if necessary**:
    - Open `keylogger.py` in a text editor.
    - Modify the time interval if needed. The default interval is 5 seconds.

    ```python
    my_keylogger = Keylogger(5)
    ```

2. **Run the keylogger:**
    ```bash
    python keylogger.py
    ```
